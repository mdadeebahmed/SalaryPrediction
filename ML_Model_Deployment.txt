Machine learning model deployment:
----------------------------------

- There many ways to deploy ML model in real time.
- Once we prepared ML model then deployement will be taken care by Sr.Data Scientist or Lead from the team.

	- We should not deliver direct code to the client.
	- We should share one url to the client to access ml model.

What is deployment?


Gmail application
-----------------

- Gmail is kind of web application

- What do you mean by web application?

- Web application is a kind of application we can access over internet.

- Web application is combination of different components
	- html files
	- images

Assuming that creator of gmail application is Daniel
----------------------------------------------------

- By using this application, he wants to provide gmail ids to everyone
- Then what Daniel need to do?

- He need to deploy/put this gmail application in server.

- Once deployed then he needs to share one common url to everyone.
- Then everyone needs to open this by using below url

- www.gmail.com


http://www.gmail.com/ 					deployed by Daniel into server

http://www.asldfhasdjffhaskd.com/		invalid app/not deployed into the server


What is server?
---------------

- Server is program which run 24/7 mode
- In server all web applications will be deployed to access this globe

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey Nireekshan I have one dataset, i have implemented machine learning model, then can i deploy that ml model into the server...

Yes we can do, today we are going to learn about that

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem statement:
------------------

Few product based companies

- Lets work on one scenario like,
	
	Salary = Exp + Test_Score + Interview_performance ?/10  


---------------------------------------------------------------------


print(regressor.predict([[2, 9, 6]]))


[52062.76112208]


Exp		-	2
Test_s	-	9
Inter_S	-	6

Result	-	[52062.76112208]
			52062.76

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps:
------
1. Unzip the file
2. Open the folder
3. Install web application framework library
	pip install flask
	
4. run app.py file by using below command
	py app.py

5. hit below url


http://127.0.0.1:5000/

http://localhost:5000

How we deployed our ml model?

Teams in Software company
-------------------------
	
1. UI team				--->	User Interface Team
								html, javascript, jquery, css, angularJS
	
2. Middleware team		--->	Java, Dotnet, Php etc

3. DB team				--->	Database team
	
4. BigData team			--->	Data engineer: Python + Pandas

5. ML Team				--->	Machine Learning Engineer: Creating models

6. Data Science Team	--->	These guys will analyze the model to confirm


Question:
----------
Who start the server?								-	Middle ware [Dev ser]
													-	cloud team [Prod ser]
													
Who will create web application?					-	UI + Middle
Who will create ml model?							-	ML team
who will analyze and confirm the model to deploy?	- 	Data Scientist



Difference servers

	-> Development Server
	-> Testing Server
	-> Staging Server
	-> Production Server

Where i have deployed this website?

in godaddy server i have deployed	-	yearly x money


-------------------------------------------------------------------

for ml model who will provide the server?

- django		-	web application Middle ware
- flask			-	web application Middle ware
- stream-lite	-	web application Middle ware
- etc

above framework by default provide the server

I have faced this question many times

model.pkl

What is a pickle file

?


This pickle file we need to give web application team

our task will be done

web application team will configure this picklet to web applicationo
